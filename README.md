# ML-with-Iris-dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization. The dataset used in this project is included as iris.csv. This dataset is freely available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
The iris dataset consists of four features:
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

The flower has three species:
* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

## Objective
The objective of this project was to predict the species of a flower using the given four features.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain an introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization(Matplotlib and Seaborn) Libraries.
